shiny_maddata
=============

R Shiny project


### Introduction
Maddata is the repository for our MADtraffic shiny app, that we developed for the MADdata contest organized by the local council of Madrid in October 2014.

MADtraffic is a shiny app that pretends to explore and analyze traffic and pollution data, independently and together. We want to provide an app that easily shows which streets are the most traffic loaded, and when, their traffic trends, and in a similar way with pollution. With this two datasets, the final purpose is to match them and try to find correlations between them.
